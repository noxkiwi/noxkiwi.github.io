# Hi, Jan here.

## Who Am I?
I'm a passionate **software developer**, born in 1991, with a journey that started back in 2005 when I first delved into **PHP development**. After completing my vocational training as a software developer in 2013, I've explored various roles across different industries, enriching my expertise in a multitude of programming languages.

## Language Is a Tool
While ``PHP`` remains my forte, I'm equally proficient in ``JavaScript``, ``Python``, ``Bash``, and ``Batch``. My diverse toolkit also includes experience with ``C#``, ``C++``, ``VB.net``, ``Cold Fusion``, and ``AutoHotKey``.

## Private Interests
- 🎧 **Music Enthusiast**: Music is my lifeblood. I thrive on live music experiences and frequent festivals.
- 🥾 **Outdoor Adventurer**: Hiking, canoeing, camping, and stargazing are my escapes. I cherish the natural world and all its wonders.
- 🚊 **Travel Buff**: I love uncovering the historical stories behind the places I visit.
- 🛣 **Driving Aficionado**: Whether it's cars, motorbikes, bicycles, or even vans - I relish the freedom and thrill of the open road.
- 🎮 **Gamer**: There's nothing like a good gaming session to unwind.
- 👨‍🍳 **Culinary Minimalist**: I enjoy crafting delicious meals with minimal ingredients, focusing on texture and flavour.

## Motto
- *"Embrace doing less."*

## Never Stop Learning!
- 👨‍💻 Staying ahead in **software technologies** like ``Angular 17`` and ``CakePHP 5``.
- 🔐 Delving into **IT security**, privacy, and cryptography.
- 🏠 Advancing **home automation** with Home Assistant and various HACS integrations.
- 🔧 Performing **repairs and fixes** for my bicycle and motorbike.
- 🥁 Occasionally, I find joy in **playing the drums**.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Let's connect and see how we can innovate together!
