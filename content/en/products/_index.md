### [noxkiwi\value](https://value.nox.kiwi/)
Once constructed, our Value objects are immutable. This immutability allows us to use them confidently as parameters and return types, relying on their integrity throughout our application. We replaced standard types like int, float, and string with our Value objects to enhance data integrity and validation.
```bash
composer install noxkiwi/value
```

### [noxkiwi\validator](https://validator.nox.kiwi/)
When validating data for integrity, you won‚Äôt just need the fact that the input is problematic, you need a very detailed information on why the value actually is problematic. So we introduced the validator structure to almost every method that handles user input. We can‚Äôt just validate numbers. There already is a collection of Validators.
Available through composer:

```bash
composer install noxkiwi/validator
```
